                    Some of these were deliverables in courses I took at UNC, and other are projects I did on my one time. Each project not only allowed
                    me to practice new found skills in CS, but also answer questions and solve problems utlizing those skills!</p>

                  <p style="text-align: justify;">My team scraped tweets about Harris Teeter to discover customer sentiments about the grocery store. We used text analysis of the tweets to determine the most negative and positive experiences customers have with Harris Teeter. We looked for ways Harris Teeter can improve relative to its closest competitors (Walmart, Trader Joe's, and Whole Foods). Our major recommendations surround Covid-safety, employee engagement, and healthy, organic food products.</p>

                  <p style="text-align: justify;">Provided with a dataset of 30 million records from LendingClub.com, my team determined an investment strategy to optimize peer-to-peer lending. We calculated a sharpe ratio to determine the risk/reward value of an investment. Our simulations revealed that choosing 5 loans in each subgrade (125 loans in total) yields better returns than choosing 20 loans in each subgrade. So we suggest investing in a few top loans from each subcategory. In other words, mixing “shaky” high grade loans (e.g. A4s, B3s) with sure bets (e.g. A1s) yields the highest returns.</p>

                  <p style="text-align: justify;">Provided with transactional data from a small business owner, my team determined a data-driven business recommendation to help a coffee shop's profitability. Our analysis focused on strategies to retain customers, increase daily transactions, and manage a rather large assortment of products. Determining the cost for each product and thus the revenue each product yields, we were able to make recommendations using regression models. For example, one of our recommendations was that the coffee shop adjust their menu by season to account for changing popularity of particular items. We pinpointed specific items and their respective seasons that would increase profitability.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">In COMP 590 Data Science for Earth, my team researched historical flooding in New Orleans with the goal of predicting flood risk over time, using machine learning skills. We collected daily data for precipitation, water gage height, tidal levels, sea temperature, hurricane seasons, wind speeds, and land sinkage in New Orleans from various databases including NOAA and USGS. We anlayzed this data in Jupyter Notebooks, using tools such as pandas, numpy, xarray, matplotlib, and geopandas. With over 4,300 data points, we used scikit-learn's Random Forest Regression and Train Test Split to create our model for flood level predictions, which had an accuracy of 78%. Our next steps in this project would be to include location variables, such as elevation and distance from levees, to determine relative risk of specified locations.</p>

                  <p style="text-align: justify;">New students in Chapel Hill can have a hard time finding places to study beyond campus and Franklin Street. Students also often find themselves in a rut if they always study in the same place. Study Buddy is a web application designed for students and residents in the Chapel Hill area that provides resources to find new study locations. Our website provides information including directions, ratings, and Covid-19 procedures for several study locations. Users can create posts to give their own feedback on locations, as well as save favorite study places to their profile. </p>

The web app displays recent tweets and associated information like a news feed. It allows users to post, edit, and delete their own tweets, as well as retweet and reply to other tweets. The web app uses AJAX + JSON to send requests to a course-specific back-end API server with 7 RESTful endpoints.</p>

                  <p style="text-align: justify;">In this project, I re-created the game 2048 using an MVC structure with JavaScript and HTML. The Model is encapsulated in a Game class with methods to move the tiles on the board, update the state of the game, and more. The View was created with some basic html. The Controller is split between the client and server side, connecting the model to the view.</p>

The application generates random hidden mines, and the user must click boxes without hitting mines to win the game. I used tools from both Java.awt and Java.swing in this creation, including BorderLayout and GridLayout, ActionEvent and ActionListener, JButton, JFrame, and JOptionPane, and MouseEvent and MouseListener.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">In COMP401 Foundation of Programming, I created a game resembling a sushi belt restaurant, using the MVC structure and design patterns such as observer/observerable. The final game includes a belt with 20 positions for sushi plates. There are five customers and four competing chefs (the fifth chef is the user, but it is not required that the user play for the program to work). With each rotation of the belt, a chef is allowed to make one plate, subtracting from his budget. If a customer both takes and consumes a chef's plate, he/she is credited the cost of the plate. A plate on the belt will age and be taken off if it spoils based on ingredients in the roll. Each plate has a unique cost based on the ingredients in the roll as well.</p>
