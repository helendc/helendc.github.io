            <h2 class="section-title">Computer Science Major</h5>
            <p>I intially became interested in Computer Science when my older sister decided to major in CS. I took a very elementary intro course in high school to dip my foot in the subject. Then in my first semester at UNC I was able to get into the Intro course to the CS major sequence - from there it's all history! I absolutely fell in love with CS. In particular I love how you can implementation solutions to a problem in so many different ways! CS always challenges me to approach problems from new perspectives. </p></button>

                <li>Introduction to Programming</li>
                <ul><li>The first college level CS course I took. I fell in love with CS and became a TA for this course afterwards!</li></ul>
                <li>Foundation of Programming</li>
                <ul><li>A course focused on object-oriented programming and a deep dive into debugging! This course inspired my <a href="./projects.html#sushipro">sushi project!</a></li></ul>
                <li>Data Structures</li>
                <ul><li>I learned about abstract data - lists, stakcs, queues, trees, graphs and more! This class really emphasized the importance of efficient coding - both in time and in space. </li></ul>
                <li>Computer Organization</li>
                <ul><li>This course covered everything from binary arithmetic to logic gates and circuits to performance measures to solving problems in C and assembly code. </li></ul>
                <li>Modern Web Programming</li>
                <ul><li>A course that taught me the ins and outs of web programming - both back end and front end. I made <a href="https://mystifying-pasteur-b729db.netlify.app/">this website</a> as final project!</li></ul>
                <li>Data Science for Earth Systems</li>
                <ul><li>This course introduced me to machine learning and data science specifically within the realm of analyzing Earth systems. For the first time, I worked with real meta-data from sources like NOAA and USGS to answer critical questions and used machine learning to answer them. For my <a href="./projects.html#floodpro">final project</a>, I analyzed flooding patterns in New Orleans!</li></ul>
                <li>Data Science in the Business World</li>
                <ul><li>Learning the basics of data science using python and jupyter notebooks, I applied my knowledge of computer science to real world business scenarios to analyze data, find patterns and anomalies, make predictions, test hypotheses, draw conclusions, and make recommendations on my findings. All the while, I also learned how to tell a story through data science and ethical practices in data science. Several of my course projects can be foud <a href="./projects.html#id">here!</a></li></ul>
                <li>Introduction to Security Concepts</li>
                <ul><li>From learning attacks with emojis representing the attacker to coding attacks and countermeasures in low level languages</li></ul>
                <li>Models of Languages and Compuations</li>
                <ul><li>This course dove into the theory of computation. I learned all about finite automata, regular languages, pushdown automata, context-free languages, and Turing machines. I mastered the skill of drawing graphical representations of these by end of the semseter.</li></ul>
                <li>Algorithms and Analysis</li>
                <ul><li>In this course, I learned different techniques of algoritm analysis and problem-solving paradigms. </li></ul>
                <li>Beyond Object Oriented Programming</li>
                <ul><li>This course challenged a lot of the basics I have learned in Computer Science, going beyond object oriented programming. We visited core computer science questions like the Dining Philsopher Problem and concurrency and evaluated them from a different perspectives.</li></ul>

            <h2 class="section-title">Mathematics Minor</h5>
            <p>I have always had a fondness for math beginning with Mad Minutes back in elementary school. I love the problem solving aspect of math, looking for solutions, putting a puzzle together, the satisfication when it all clicks and makes sense. Pursuing a minor in Mathematics pushed me to use my brain in different ways.</p></button>

                <li>Calculus of Functions of One Variable I & II and of Several Variables</li>
                <ul><li>Calculus classes were surely challengely, but boy did they pay off - in every semester after I completed calculus I saw derivatives, integrals, or an important theorem reappear in my other STEM classes.</li></ul>
                <li>Discrete Mathematics</li>
                <ul><li>I was pleasantly surprised when I discovered math beyond Calculus. This class was particularly interesting as it intersected with many logical Computer Science topics. This was also my first course that transitioned to online learning during the Pandemic - talk about a learning curve!</li></ul>
                <li>First Course in Differential Equations</li>
                <ul><li>Yet another fun math course beyond Calculus. I also took this course online during the pandemic; class often featured my professors dogs saying hello and even an occasional song played on the guitar when we were learning about the wave equation as shown by plucking a guitar string!</li></ul>
                <li>Linear Algebra for Applications</li>
                <ul><li>Taking Linear Algebra during a summer session was an awesome experience because I could focus all my attention to one topic.</li></ul>
                <li>Combinatorial Mathematics</li>
                <ul><li>This course was phenomial. It was my first course back in person after the Pandemic, and this course focused on the HOW rather than the answer to problems, which I loved.</li></ul>
                <li>Introduction to Probability</li>
                <ul><li>I took this course during the same semester that I took Data Science in Business World - the intersection of these two courses was perfect timing. I was learning all about probability distributions in my math course and applying them in machine-learning forms to real world scenarios in my Data Science course.</li></ul>
